flex-direction
Up to this point, weâ€™ve only covered flex items that stretch and shrink horizontally and wrap vertically. 
As previously stated, flex containers have two axes: a major axis and a cross axis. 
By default, the major axis is horizontal and the cross axis is vertical.

The major axis is used to position flex items with the following properties:

1.justify-content
2.flex-wrap
3.flex-grow
4.flex-shrink

The cross axis is used to position flex items with the following properties:

1.align-items
2.align-content

The major axis and cross axis are interchangeable. We can switch them using the flex-direction property. 
If we add the flex-direction property and give it a value of column, the flex items will be ordered vertically, not horizontally.
