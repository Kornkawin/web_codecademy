Web Fonts Using @font-face
Fonts can also be added using a @font-face ruleset in your CSS stylesheet instead of using a <link> element in your HTML document.
As mentioned earlier, fonts can be downloaded just like any other file on the web. They come in a few different file formats, such as:
• OTF (OpenType Font)
• TTF (TrueType Font)
• WOFF (Web Open Font Format)
• WOFF2 (Web Open Font Format 2)
The different formats are a progression of standards for how fonts will work with different browsers, with WOFF2 being the most progressive.
It's a good idea to include TTF, WOFF, and WOFF2 formats with your @font-face rule to ensure compatibility on all browsers.
