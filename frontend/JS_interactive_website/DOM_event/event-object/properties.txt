JavaScript stores events as event objects with their related data and functionality as properties and methods.

Example:
1. the .target property to access the element that triggered the event. เช่น share.onclick = sharePhoto; แบบนี้ share คือ target element.
2. the .type property to access the name of the event.
3. the .timeStamp property to access the number of milliseconds that passed since the document loaded and the event was triggered.




let social = document.getElementById('social-media');
let share = document.getElementById('share-button');
let text = document.getElementById('text');

// Write your code below
let sharePhoto = function(event) {
  event.target.style.display = 'none';
  text.innerHTML = event.timeStamp;
};

share.onclick = sharePhoto;
