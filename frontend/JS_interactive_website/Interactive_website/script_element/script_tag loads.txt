When the HTML parser encounters a <script> element, it loads the script then executes its contents before parsing the rest of the HTML. 

The two main points to note here are that:

1. The HTML parser does NOT process the next element in the HTML file until it loads and executes the <script> element, 
thus leading to a delay in load time and resulting in a poor user experience.

2. Additionally, scripts are loaded sequentially, so if one script depends on another script, 
they should be placed in that very order inside the HTML file.
