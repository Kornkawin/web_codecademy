let eventTarget = document.getElementById('targetElement');
eventTarget.onclick = function() {
  // this block of code will run
}

1. First, we accessed the DOM element that serves as the event target 
	by its ID using document.getElementById('targetElement').
2. Then we created the event handler property which consists of the event target 
	followed by the event name (the prefix on- and the event type.) In this example, 
	we’re using the click event which fires when the user presses and releases a mouse 
	button on a DOM element.
3. Lastly, we assigned an event handler function to the property.
