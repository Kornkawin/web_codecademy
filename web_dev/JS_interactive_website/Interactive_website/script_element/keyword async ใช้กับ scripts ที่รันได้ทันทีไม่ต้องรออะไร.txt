The async attribute loads and executes the script asynchronously with the rest of the webpage.

The script will not wait until the entire page is parsed: it will execute immediately after it has been downloaded. (โหลดปุ๊ปรันทันที)

"async" is useful for scripts that are independent of other scripts in order to function. (Optimized load time)
