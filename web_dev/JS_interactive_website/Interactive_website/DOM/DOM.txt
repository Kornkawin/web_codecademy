What is DOM?

The DOM is a logical tree-like Model that organizes a web page’s HTML Document as an Object.
Note: There are other types of documents, such as XML and SVG, that are also modeled as DOM structures.

The DOM is a language-agnostic structure implemented by browsers to allow for web scripting languages, 
like JavaScript, to access, modify, and update the structure of an HTML web page in an organized way.

For this reason, we like to think of the DOM as the link between an HTML web page and scripting languages.




The DOM as a Tree Structure

In the DOM tree, the top-most node is called the root node, and it represents the HTML document. 
The descendants of the root node are the HTML tags in the document, starting with the <html> tag 
followed by the <head> and <body> tags and so on.




Nodes and Elements in the DOM

There are nine different types of node objects in the DOM tree. In our diagram, the node objects 
with the sharp-edge rectangles are of the type ELEMENT, while the rounded edge rectangles are of 
type TEXT, because they represent the text inside the HTML paragraph elements.




Attributes of Element Node

Much like an element in an HTML page, the DOM allows us to access a node’s attributes, such as its class, 
id, and inline style.
