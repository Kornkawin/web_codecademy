CONDITIONS
Here is the list of comparison operators for numbers you can use within bash scripts:

Equal: -eq
Not equal: -ne
Less than or equal: -le
Less than: -lt
Greater than or equal: -ge
Greater than: -gt
Is null: -z

When comparing strings, it is best practice to put the variable into quotes ("). 
This prevents errors if the variable is null or contains spaces. The common operators for comparing strings are:

Equal: ==
Not equal: !=
if [ "$foo" == "$bar"]
